### A simple game made on JavaScript, CSS and HTML
Mission is to construct a single-page website that plays a fully-functional game. In order to see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact harmoniously to produce a dynamic website.

## Chore Door

Believe it or not, I built every feature in this game - from the layout to the logic. I had to be patient, take creative risks, and most importantly, fun!
